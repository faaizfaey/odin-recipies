    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the only crispy fried chicken recipe you'll ever need. Why? It combines all the tried-and-true tricks to ensure the juiciest, most flavorful, crispiest chicken every time.</p>
    <p>Most fried chicken is cooked at a high temperature throughout the frying process. This one, however, only starts at a very high heat â€” after browning, the heat is reduced for about 30 minutes. You'll turn up the temperature again at the end, locking in that crispy texture.</p>
    <p>Paprika adds smoky flavor and has a low smoke point, which helps with browning the chicken.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Take you cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.</li>

        <li>Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish towel or waxed paper.<strong>Let sit until the flour is of a paste like consistency.</strong> </li>
        <li>Fill a large skillet about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. Heat until very hot</li>
        <li>Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in hot oil on both sides.</li>
        <li>When browned, reduce the heat and cover the skillet; let cook for 30 minutes. Remove cover, raise heat again, and continue to fry until crispy.</li>
        <li>Drain the fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you have, you may have to fry in a few shifts.</li>
